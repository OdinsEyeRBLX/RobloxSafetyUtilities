## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to hold helpful Roblox safety codes, made in multiple languages. 
We're a group which works against Roblox NSFW games, and wish to make Roblox communities safer. This tool is jointly developed by a small team of users from 3 groups.

## Usage
Everything in this tool is open source, and you may use it how you like. We rather recommend people use it that way because what we've given is base code which would work in-game and in bigger tools after completion by you, the user.
Lua (Roblox Game codes), Python and JavaScript can freely be used as you like.

## Group Logging
Every group in KNWON_ERP_GROUPS.TXT is manually checked by a team of users. We flag them on the basis of:
- Amount of inappropriate accounts in the group
- Uploading/owning inappropriate game assets
- Uploading bypassed clothing
- Group owner & admins being inappropriate accounts
- Groups containing a large amount of inappropriate accounts (Invaded groups)
- Groups that are clearly made for an inappropriate intent and can pose a threat to minors
